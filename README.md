# Health-Insurance
This is a website project that I did as a Data Science Freelance for predicting how much Health Insurance someone will get based on their input. I used Random Forest Classifier with K-Fold parameter tuning to get an accuracy of 94%. The website was made using HTML and the model was deployed using Flask.

The dataset used in this project has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
